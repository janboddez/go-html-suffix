# go-html-suffix
Append '.html' to WordPress page URLs.

## Installation and Usage
Install. Activate. Done! Note: blog post permalinks are dealt with through Settings > Permalinks in WP Admin. (Set 'Custom Structure' to end in `/%postname%.html`, `/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%.html`, or something similar.)
